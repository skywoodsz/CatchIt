# CatchIt - ROS Inference  
This package used for autonomously search and grab objects in a large scale by unmanned aerial manipulators(UAM), which is based on ROS. We propose a novel detection and control framework for UAM to solve the problem of accurate grasping in a large-scale area, which consists of two stages: preliminary localization and precise localization.
